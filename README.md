# Spotify to Youtube
*After a year of not looking at this, I'm surprised it still works after just adding one "?" after "watch". Pretty surprised how well the code has stood up.

-The gist of this program is to get the first search result of "SONG NAME official", because most all the times, the "song name + official" had a solid search result, even if it wasn't actually from the official artist's youtube channel/

I did this with no APIs, which means I am very limited in what I can do. I didn't use the Spotify/Youtube APIs because for the user, it is quite the hassle to sign up for all that and go through with their ordeals. Overall, I'm satisfied with the result, and I felt I learned a lot.

All you have to do to use this is to copy and paste your Spotify playlist url when prompted to in the code. Just copy and paste the code into Python and run the program. Then, get the link to your spotify playist url and press enter.
