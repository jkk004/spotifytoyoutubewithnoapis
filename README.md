# Spotify to Youtube
I did this with no APIs, which means I am very limited in what I can do. Unfortunately, due to the limitations imposed by Spotify, the maximum songs I can get from a playlist is 30. Overall, I'm satisfied with the result, and I felt I learned a lot.

All you have to do to use this is to copy and paste your Spotify playlist url
