# Spotify to Youtube
I did this with no APIs, which means I am very limited in what I can do. I didn't use the Spotify/Youtube APIs because for the user, it is quite the hassle to sign up for all that and go through with their ordeals. Overall, I'm satisfied with the result, and I felt I learned a lot.

All you have to do to use this is to copy and paste your Spotify playlist url when prompted to in the code
