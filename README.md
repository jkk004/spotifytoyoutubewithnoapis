# Spotify to Youtube
The main reason I thought of making this was because for my dad's shop, I wanted to run some music from my Spotify playlist. However, we don't have Spotify premium so ads play time to time. Therefore, I thought I should convert my Spotify playlist to it's Youtube counterpart.

I did this with no APIs, which means I am very limited in what I can do. I didn't use the Spotify/Youtube APIs because for the user, it is quite the hassle to sign up for all that and go through with their ordeals. Unfortunately, due to the limitations imposed by Spotify, the maximum songs I can get from a playlist is 30. Overall, I'm satisfied with the result, and I felt I learned a lot.

All you have to do to use this is to copy and paste your Spotify playlist url when prompted to in the code
